  <h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>
  <p>
A croissant is more than just a pastry—it's a delicate expression of craftsmanship, culture, and comfort. Despite its strong association with French cuisine, the croissant’s roots trace back to Austria, where the kipferl, a crescent-shaped bread, inspired what would become a global icon of breakfast indulgence. What sets the croissant apart is its signature texture: buttery, crisp on the outside, and airy within, thanks to a labor-intensive process known as lamination—the folding and layering of yeast-leavened dough with butter. When baked, these thin layers puff up into golden perfection. Whether enjoyed plain, filled with chocolate, or paired with coffee on a quiet Parisian morning, the croissant remains a timeless symbol of elegance in simplicity.
